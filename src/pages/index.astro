        <p>
          I enjoy breaking down systems to understand how they fail and using that understanding to help teams build more secure and reliable products. My background is in DevOps and cloud native systems, and over time my interests have shifted toward product security, application security, and threat modeling.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been building depth in application security through hands-on learning, working through real-world web vulnerability classes like authentication issues, IDORs, injections, business logic flaws, and OWASP Top 10 risks. I reason about vulnerabilities from an attacker's perspective while keeping mitigations practical and developer-friendly.
        </p>
        <p>
          More recently, I've been exploring how AI can support security work, especially in accelerating manual processes like threat modeling and design reviews, while keeping humans in the loop for judgment and accountability.
